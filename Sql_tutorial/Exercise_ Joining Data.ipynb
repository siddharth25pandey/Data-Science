For example, to select just the third row of the `pets` table from the tutorial, we could use the query in the picture below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RccsXBr.png) \n\nYou can also use `%` as a \"wildcard\" for any number of characters. So you can also get the third row with:\n\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT * \n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` \n        WHERE Name LIKE '%ipl%'\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nTry this yourself. Write a query that selects the `id`, `title` and `owner_user_id` columns from the `posts_questions` table. \n- Restrict the results to rows that contain the word \"bigquery\" in the `tags` column. \n- Include rows where there is other text in addition to the word \"bigquery\" (e.g., if a row has a tag \"bigquery-sql\", your results should include that too).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code here\nquestions_query = \"\"\"\n                  SELECT id, title, owner_user_id\n                  FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`\n                  WHERE tags LIKE '%bigquery%'\n                  \"\"\"\n# Set up the query (cancel the query if it would use too much of \n# your quota, with the limit set to 1 GB)\nsafe_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(maximum_bytes_billed=10**10)\nquestions_query_job = client.query(questions_query, job_config=safe_config) # Your code goes here\n\n# API request - run the query, and return a pandas DataFrame\nquestions_results = questions_query_job.to_dataframe() # Your code goes here\n\n# Preview results\nprint(questions_results.head())\n\n# Check your answer\nq_3.check()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For a hint or the solution, uncomment the appropriate line below.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#q_3.hint()\n#q_3.solution()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4) Your first join\nNow that you have a query to select questions on any given topic (in this case, you chose \"bigquery\"), you can find the answers to those questions with a **JOIN**.  \n\nWrite a query that returns the `id`, `body` and `owner_user_id` columns from the `posts_answers` table for answers to \"bigquery\"-related questions. \n- You should have one row in your results for each answer to a question that has \"bigquery\" in the tags.  \n- Remember you can get the tags for a question from the `tags` column in the `posts_questions` table.\n\nHere's a reminder of what a **JOIN** looked like in the tutorial:\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT p.Name AS Pet_Name, o.Name AS Owner_Name\n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` as p\n        INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.owners` as o \n            ON p.ID = o.Pet_ID\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nIt may be useful to scroll up and review the first several rows of the `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` tables.
